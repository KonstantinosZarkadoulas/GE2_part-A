*Caption:* "Collapsing Ice Shelf Reveals a Possible New Island, Eastern Antarctica
November 15, 1989 - January 9, 2022
The rapid collapse of the Glenzer and Conger ice shelves in eastern Antarctica this year has unveiled a possible new island. The round, white mound has not moved, even though the ice surrounding it has vanished. This suggests that it's an ice island. Ice islands are emerging features in Antarctica as warming air and ocean temperatures due to human-caused climate change continue to melt floating ice shelves.

*Caption:* "Information and communication technologies (ICTs) are a collection of devices and services that acquire, transfer, and display data and information digitally. These include the internet, wireless networks, cell phones, computers, software, middleware, video conferencing, and social networking. ICTs can contribute to addressing the world’s most critical climate challenges and facilitating the much-needed transition to a circular economy. They can also be used to monitor climate change and help mitigate and adapt to climate change."
